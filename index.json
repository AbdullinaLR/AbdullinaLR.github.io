Typically, the main project tree is stored in the local or a remote repository to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows them to fix, combine changes made by different project participants,rollback to any earlier version of the project, if required. Classical version control systems use a centralized model, assuming the existence of a single repository for storing files. Most of the version control functions are carried out by a special server. The project participant (user) before starting work through certain command gets the version of files it needs. After making changes, the user commits the new version to the repository. This does not remove previous versions. from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can save an incomplete version of the modified files, and produce the so-called delta- compression—keep only changes between successive versions, which allows you to reduce the amount of stored data. Version control systems support traceability and resolution conflicts that may arise when several people work on one file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (auto-mathically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, blocking is not allows other users to obtain a working copy or prevents modification working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support multiple versions of the same file, keeping a common history of changes up to the branch point versions and each branch’s own change histories.Information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the centralthe repository is optional. Among the classic VCS, CVS, Subversion are the most famous, and among the distributed nyh - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial.

He immediately drew the attention of critics of the Silver Age to the personality of the beginning poetess. Critics and readers unanimously noted the accuracy and expressiveness of Akhmatov’s poetic style, the clarity and clarity of the artistic depiction of reality, the visibility and delineation of images, the soft inconsistency of the author’s syntax. Mikhail Kuzmin left an interesting comment in the preface: “It seems to us that, unlike other lovers of things, Anna Akhmatova has the ability to understand and love things precisely in their incomprehensible connection with the minutes experienced. Often she accurately and definitely mentions some object (a glove on the table, a cloud like a squirrel skin in the sky, the yellow light of candles in the bedroom, a cocked hat in Tsarskoye Selo Park) seemingly unrelated to the whole poem, abandoned and forgotten, but it is from this mention that a more palpable prick, a sweeter poison, we feel. Without this squirrel skin, the whole poem, perhaps, would not have that fragile shrillness that it has […]”.\nDescriptions of the state of mind of the lyrical heroine set a minor mood for the poem. The heroine recalls how she once felt both sadness and longing, but now she has lost this ability. Therefore, she calls herself a “toy”, compares with a cockatoo. In addition to sadness, one even feels some disappointment both in the “city of mysteries” and in oneself. “The hour before sunset”: when darkness descends on the city, and a person is left alone with his thoughts and insomnia. “Wind from the sea”: a symbol of lost liberty, purity, naturalness. “Go away”: there is already an echo of family relationships.\nIn the intonation, outwardly everyday, one can feel the expectation of a miracle. The ray of the sun, to which the heroine prays to him, became a symbol of hope, a mysterious promise of a happy future. In the morning, the heroine is immersed in thoughts, but in the evening she becomes cheerful, looking at the ray, which gives her hope and gives her peace. “Heart in half”: the feeling of a young gifted person at the dawn of life. The courses will soon be completed, and she already has a fiancé, also a poet. The colors in this poem are muted, even the beam is “pale, thin.” She listens to herself and time, suffers, not knowing herself why. There are such outwardly inconspicuous moments when a person suddenly, with surprise, somehow especially clearly realizes that he lives, exists, that he also has a destiny and a path.\nShe left the front door unlocked in the hope that her chosen one would nevertheless change his anger for mercy and come to reconcile. But this, apparently, did not happen. Therefore, a woman who voices her thoughts in the poem in the first person, can only “watch how the stripes go out in the sunset darkness of the needles” and listen to the night rustles, hoping to distinguish among the conversations under the window the voice of the only person who is now more than anything in the world for her. want to see. She looks for a long time (sometimes with an unseeing look) at the surrounding nature, “sunset stripes”, shudders with secret joy if the sound of someone’s voice suddenly sounds strangely like the voice of a loved one. In the final quatrain, built on contrast, the poetess describes her mood swings: everything is lost, but she was sure that you would come. The paradoxical nature of this statement emphasizes the nervous, desperate intonation of the poem.\nThus, the psychological detail plays a significant role in creating the emotive space in A.A. Akhmatova. All the details help to better understand what the lyrical hero and the poetess herself are going through.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"5302252e8f3539312931c7276cda35e3","permalink":"https://AbdullinaLR.github.io/project/project2/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project2/","section":"project","summary":"Анализ эмотивного состяния в стихотворении А.А.Ахматовой","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Роль психологической детали в создании эмотивного пространства текста.

When studying large and hard-to-reach areas, they are of particular importance as a source of independent, objective and up-to-date information. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in the creation and development of means and technologies for remote sensing of the Earth. In addition, the number of launched satellites of high and ultra-high resolution is increasing every year. As a result, the resulting volume of data grows exponentially and is difficult to centrally store and process, while processing methods and algorithms are delayed due to the capabilities of new satellite sensors.\nIn many environmental monitoring systems, satellite data and the results of their processing play a very important role. Therefore, almost all such systems today have devices for working with satellite data. To simplify the creation of such blocks and their subsequent operation, a special technology is being developed. One of its key elements is the technology for creating automated satellite data storage systems (hereinafter referred to as SSDS), which is discussed in the presented work.\nIn the presented work, the main requirements for the functioning of the DSHS are formulated, the characteristics of satellite data archiving systems are analyzed, and the basic structure of the automated DSHS is considered. This technology can optimize the collection and storage of large amounts of data.
